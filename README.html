## P2550-PDA-project2

# Summary
This study investigates the impact of psychological and demographic factors on smoking cessation in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), with a focus on the effectiveness of varenicline and behavioral treatments. The project employs a logistic model with L1 and L0 regularization, a method that simplifies complexity while selecting key predictors and interaction terms influencing the outcome: smoking abstinence. Notable predictors include behavioral activation, current vs. past MDD, and the interaction between BDI score and readiness to quit smoking, highlighting a combined impact of treatment and mental health status on cessation success. The modelâ€™s Area Under the Curve (AUC) reaches 0.76, indicating moderate predictive power.
