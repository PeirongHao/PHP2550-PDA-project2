Summary
Smoking cessation is an important public health challenge, particularly for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), who are more likely to smoke heavily and experience severe withdrawal symptoms. This project aimed to analyze predictors of smoking abstinence among adult smokers with MDD while evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy interventions. Data from a 2Ã—2 factorial randomized clinical trial involving 300 participants were used. The trial compared `varenicline` with `placebo` and `behavioral activation for smoking cessation (BASC)` with `standard behavioral treatment (ST)`. Using L1 and L0 regularization techniques, the project identified key predictors influencing smoking abstinence, including the `Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTCD) score` and the interaction between `varenicline` and the `nicotine metabolism ratio`. The findings underscore the importance of `pharmacotherapy` with `varenicline` and highlight additional factors that could inform personalized smoking cessation strategies.
